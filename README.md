## Other Notes ##

### Maven ###

We use [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) to handle our dependencies and building. To build the plugin JAR file using Maven, just run the `mvn` command.
  
Make sure you only use the file named `HarryPotterSpells`. Out of the others one won't work and the other is far too big!

### .classpath and .project ###

If you are having issues importing the project into your Eclipse IDE you may find the following files useful:
+ [.classpath](http://www.mediafire.com/view/3cf26n282tyf044/.classpath)
+ [.project](http://www.mediafire.com/view/b3c36r69nabnw3v/.project)

If these files need updating notify Kezz101 and he will re-upload them for you.
